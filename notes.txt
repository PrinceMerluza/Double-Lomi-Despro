------------------------

2016 10 14 NOTES... @ DESPRO MOCK DEFENSE

KNOWN:
When sending SMS while SIM900 is busy, the Arduino will not be able to receive 
and evaluate the SMS.



SOLVED:
sendimg message lcd <--  busy sending message when sim900 is SENDING

open door command <- implemented

alarm immediately on opening <- putting prevT of door on close instance.




------------- NOTES/CONSIDERATION ---------------
-menuState = 5, or the refceiving state. not yet implemented. still 
considering if lcd should be locked as prima facie there is no effect 
either way. pagiisipan pa.

-to check kung pwede short as replacement for int. spec for sensor gas threshold.

-SENDING MESSAGE will delay everything in the program.
especially if PB is too large.
need to check if sim900 can still receive the message with no problem
as process busy with sending message.

------------ BUGGY SHIT ---------------------
-pressinf 'B' back from Lst Contacts with 0 contacts will MATRIX the LCD 
display

-minsan kulang ang narereceive na message. Ex: imbes na 'bukas' 'buka' 
lang. possible fix is limiting txt commands to 4 or finding reason of this 
fkin error.

----------- FIXED BUGS:- -------------------
-countContacts return (real number of contacts) - 1 because AT+CPBR=1 is 

not running for some reason.l making the first number nonexistent
FIUXED: changed countContacts() to statechange from message(alert) to 

previous state. 9/13/2016	+--																																																																																																																										+
